# 📊 Fantastic LinkedIn Post Template

## 🚀 I built an AI that pays my AWS bill for me. Here's how.

---

For the past 6 months, I've been working on a secret project that's fundamentally changed how my team thinks about cloud costs.

I was tired of the same old advice: "Buy Reserved Instances," "Delete old snapshots." It's all reactive and manual.

So, I built **Project Aegis**: an autonomous, self-driving cost optimization engine for AWS.

### 🔧 It's not a script. It's not a dashboard. It's a full system that:

✅ **Discovers savings** using AWS Compute Optimizer & more  
✅ **Validates every change** in a safe, isolated environment (no more "works on my machine" for cost!)  
✅ **Implements changes automatically** via Terraform  
✅ **Monitors for anomalies** and kills runaway costs before they happen

---

## 📊 The Results?

🎯 **52% reduction** in our monthly AWS bill  
💰 **$177,840** in annualized savings  
✅ **Zero** production incidents caused by the automation

---

## 💎 It leverages the full power of AWS's native intelligence:

🚀 **Graviton** for 40% better price-performance  
💸 **Spot Instances** for up to 90% savings on compute  
🔍 **Cost Anomaly Detection** as an automated immune system

## 🎉 Why I'm Open-Sourcing This

I'm open-sourcing the entire project today because I believe **the future of cloud engineering is autonomous**. We should be building products, not babysitting bills.
